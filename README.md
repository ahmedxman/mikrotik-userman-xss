# Exploit Title: MikroTik RouterOS < v7 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UserManager Web Interface *Google Dork: N/A (UserManager interface is typically not publicly exposed) **Date: 2025-07-03 **Exploit Author: Ahmed Mutaher **Vendor Homepage: https://mikrotik.com/ **Software Link: https://mikrotik.com/download **Version: All versions prior to v7.0 **Tested on: - RB1100AHx4 (v6.48.2) - RB750GL (v6.39) - CCR1009-8G-1S-1S+ (v6.41) - x86 (v5.20, v6.49.18) **CVE*: Pending Assignment --- ## 📄 Description A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in MikroTik RouterOS versions prior to v7, specifically in the UserManager web interface. This flaw can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, allowing JavaScript injection via a specially crafted URL without requiring a valid login session. During analysis of the source code of the /userman page, it was discovered that the application attempts to mitigate input by discarding any content after the double slash (//). However, by repeating the payload and crafting it carefully, this behavior can be bypassed and JavaScript can be executed in the browser context. --- ## 🔥 Vulnerable Endpoint 
http:///userman/',true);alert('XSS');//',true);alert('XSS');//
--- ## 🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC) *Payload*: 
http://192.168.88.1/userman/',true);alert('XSS');//',true);alert('XSS');//
--- ## ✅ Steps to Reproduce 1. Open the target RouterOS UserManager URL in a browser without logging in. 2. Inspect the page source and identify the reflected input behavior. 3. Notice that the system strips content after //. 4. Craft the payload to repeat the malicious code to bypass the filtering. 5. When the payload is executed, an alert box is triggered, proving the XSS vulnerability. --- ## 💥 Impact - JavaScript execution without authentication. - Possible phishing or redirection attacks. - Can be used as part of a social engineering chain to trick admins or users. --- ## 🔐 Mitigation - Sanitize all user input using context-aware encoding (e.g., htmlspecialchars() in PHP). - Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). - Avoid reflecting unsanitized GET parameters in HTML or JavaScript contexts. --- ## 🧾 Disclosure This vulnerability was discovered by *Ahmed Mutaher* on July 3, 2025. Awaiting official CVE assignment and vendor response. --- ## 📬 Contact - GitHub: [github.com/ahmed-mutaher](https://github.com/ahmedxman)
